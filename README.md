This is a small program for merging the HEX address.
The merge operation performs as below:
  ->  If the HEX record type is 04 and the ELA high address is 0x8000 segment,
  ->  then merge the 0x8000 high addresses  with 0xA000 high address.
  ->  Sort the data record with low address, from the lowest to the highest low address.
